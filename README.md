Three main building blocks:
- Workflows
- jobs
- steps

You can add workflows to your github repository.
Workflows can contains one or more jobs.
One job can contains one or more steps.

NOTE: All workflows should reside inside ".github/workflows/*".

How to run your workflow using github actions?
-- As soon as workflow will be commited to github repository, github will identify those workflows in .github/workflows subfolder and auto populates it.

If you need to run multiple shell commands (or multi-line commands, e.g., for readability), you can easily do so by adding the pipe symbol (|) as a value after the run: key.

Like this:
...
run: |
    echo "First output"
    echo "Second output"
This will run both commands in one step.
